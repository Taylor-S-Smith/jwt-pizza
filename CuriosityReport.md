# Curiosity Report - Common Vulnerability Scoring System

I was intrigued by the CVSS. Before I started to do research, I generated the following questions. Below are my findings:

## What is CVSS?

CVSS is a standard way to compare the severity of vulnerabilities. It allows any vulnerability to be compared to any other one that is scored using this system.

## Who created it?

It was developed by the National Infrastructure Advisory Council while they were working an a research project [1]. I unfortunatley can't find details on the original research project that inspired it.

## Has it developed over time?

Yes! We are actually on version 4 of the system. When it initially released, it wasn't peer reviewed and a immediatly work began on a second version.

## How did it become the standard? Did it have to outcompete other standards?



## What are the shortcommings of the system, if any?
